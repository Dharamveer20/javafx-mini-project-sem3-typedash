Bangladesh is a small and beautiful country in South Asia. 
We got independence in 1971 from Pakistan after a long war. 
Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country. 
16 December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered. 
And 26th March is our Independence Day because in 1971’s 26th March Ziaur Rahman declared our independence from Chittagong.
We are the only nation that sacrifices lives for language and now it is known as International Mother Language Day on 21st February. 
More than 180 countries celebrate this day. 
Bangladesh is a very beautiful country to see. 
Bangladesh is a small country with a huge population. 
The total area of Bangladesh is 147,570 square kilometers but the total population is more than 164 million. 
Still, it is a green and naturally beautiful country. 
Our country is growing economically and it is doing well in export too. 
We are the leader in world garments exporting right after china. 
Not only in the economy, but we also good at sports too. 
Our cricket team is one of the top seven teams in the world. 
Bangladesh has a very heart touching history behind.
